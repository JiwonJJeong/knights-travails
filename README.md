# knights-travails
Project from The Odin Project to find fastest path a chess knight can take using implicit graph DSA.

## Skills Used
- Decide and create data structure to represent chess knight's position and future moves
- Implement breadth-first search algorithm using queues, while loops, and for each loops
- Modularize code between data structure and search algorithm with factory functions
